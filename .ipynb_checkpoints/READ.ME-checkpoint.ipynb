    "* Create a software pipeline that takes a video as an input and identifies vehicle's location.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To achieve this goal here are the steps taken:\n",
    "* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.\n"

Later it performs a 64x64 window search where it just refers to the relative position of the HOG features already extracted. I've done two alterations to the original function: 1st the cells_per_step were reduced to 1 so it covers more area of the image (similar to overlap), the other change performed was that this function, in addition of returning an image with boxes drawn around the the positive matches, also returns a list of lists with the position of the positive predictions (i.e. where the classifier believes there's a car), that will be later used in the heat functions to try to reduce false positives and group boxes belonging to the same car.\n"
